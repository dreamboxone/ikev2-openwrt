# workflow's feed notification reports success while the dispatch never
# arrives, so a published tag is invisible to `apk update` until the feed is
# rebuilt by hand. Every release that skipped that step sat unused.
#
# Usage: scripts/release.sh [--deploy host[,host...]]
#
# Run it from a clean tree whose release.env already carries the new version.
# It refuses to invent one: bump release.env and the Makefile literal first,
# and commit them.

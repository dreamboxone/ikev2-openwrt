# Router-side scripts run against BusyBox applets, not GNU coreutils. Developer
# machines and CI runners provide the GNU versions, so a GNU-only option is
# accepted locally and every test passes while the router silently does
# something else. The confirmed example is `sort -o`: BusyBox is built without
# CONFIG_FEATURE_SORT_BIG, ignores the option, leaves the target file untouched
# and writes the sorted result to stdout instead. That corrupted the inbound
# user-policy sets and leaked list contents into command output.
#
# The staged package is scanned rather than the source tree, so the list can
# never drift from what actually reaches a router, and the package lifecycle
# scripts generated into CONTROL are covered too. Only patterns verified
# against the supported OpenWrt BusyBox build belong here.

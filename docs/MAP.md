# Repository map

Where things live, so a task starts at the right file instead of a search.
Pair it with `docs/INDEX.md`, which locates a function by name.

Read this first; read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` only for the section you need, and
`docs/OPERATIONS.md` only when running something against a router.

## The shape of it

One OpenWrt package, `luci-app-ikev2-manager`, containing three things:

- **runtime** - POSIX shell helpers under `/usr/libexec`, driven by procd init
  scripts and by the LuCI pages through rpcd
- **LuCI pages** - five views plus a status-overview widget, all built on one
  shared design system rather than stock CBI
- **checks** - 46 scripts under `scripts/`, run as one suite by
  `scripts/ci-check.sh`

Two sibling repositories, not in this tree: `ikev2-site-link-openwrt` (the
site-to-site package, own release) and `openwrt-feed` (the shared signed feed
every router installs from).

## Runtime helpers

Installed to `/usr/libexec`, called by init scripts and by LuCI through the
rpcd `file exec` ACL in `luci-ikev2-manager/acl.json`.

| helper | source | owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ikev2-manager-system` | `ikev2-manager-runtime/ikev2-manager-system.sh` | system state, dependencies, DNS transactions, DNS segments, device policy, routing pause |
| `ikev2-manager` | `luci-ikev2-manager/ikev2-manager.sh` | inbound server, VPN users, ACME, client profile, raw swanctl config |
| `ikev2-domain-router` | `ikev2-manager-runtime/ikev2-domain-router.sh` | sing-box FakeIP engine, tunnel DNS, nftables rules |
| `ikev2-device-routing` | `ikev2-manager-runtime/ikev2-device-routing.sh` | per-device policy marks and their nft chains |
| `ikev2-user-policy` | `ikev2-manager-runtime/ikev2-user-policy.sh` | inbound session admission, driven by VICI events |
| `ikev2-health` | `ikev2-manager-runtime/ikev2-health.sh` | the watcher loop: FakeIP repair, tunnel DNS failover |
| `ikev2-devices` | `luci-ikev2-domains/ikev2-devices.sh` | LAN inventory the pages read |
| `ikev2-domains-community` | `luci-ikev2-domains/community-domains.sh` | service catalogue and destination lists |
| `ikev2-sync-vips` | `ikev2-manager-runtime/ikev2-sync-vips.sh` | virtual IP reconciliation |
| `ikev2-discord-voice` | `ikev2-manager-runtime/ikev2-discord-voice.sh` | Discord voice range handling |

Init scripts in `ikev2-manager-runtime/*.init`: `ikev2-domain-router`,
`ikev2-dns-segments`, `ikev2-health`, `ikev2-user-policy`, `ikev2-xfrm`.

## LuCI pages

Each view is one file. The menu points at the installed resource name, which
carries a version suffix - see `luci-ikev2-manager/AGENTS.md` for why.

| page | source | installed as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overview | `luci-ikev2-manager/setup.js` | `view/ikev2-manager/setup-v2.js` |
| Outbound Tunnel | `luci-ikev2-manager/client.js` | `view/ikev2-manager/client-v2.js` |
| Policy Routing | `luci-ikev2-domains/editor.js` | `view/ikev2-domains/editor-v4.js` |
| Inbound Server | `luci-ikev2-manager/settings.js` | `view/ikev2-manager/settings-v2.js` |
| VPN Users | `luci-ikev2-manager/users.js` | `view/ikev2-manager/users-v6.js` |
| Status widget | `luci-ikev2-manager/status-widget.js` | `view/status/include/06_ikev2-manager.js` |

`luci-ikev2-manager/shared.js` is the design system, the Russian dictionary and
the action lifecycle used by all of them; it installs as `shared-v9.js`.
`luci-ikev2-manager/menu.json` wires the pages, `acl.json` grants every helper
call and input-file write.

## Configuration

- `openwrt/files/etc/config/ikev2-manager` - packaged defaults, installed to
  `/usr/share/ikev2-manager/defaults/` and merged on install
- UCI sections: `client`, `server`, `domains`, `dns`, `dnsseg_*` (one per DNS
  segment), `device_*` (one per device override)

## Checks

`scripts/ci-check.sh` runs everything. Two families:

- `scripts/check-*.sh` - invariants that hold regardless of behaviour: version
  sync, public tree, pinned actions, BusyBox compatibility, the LuCI UI
  contract, the rpcd ACL coverage, the function index
- `scripts/test-*.sh` and `scripts/test-*.js` - behaviour, run against stubbed
  UCI and a stubbed LuCI environment

`scripts/AGENTS.md` explains how to add one and why every check gets mutated
before it is trusted.

## Build and release

- `release.env` - the single source of package identity; the SDK `Makefile`
  repeats the literals and `scripts/check-version-sync.sh` fails on drift
- `scripts/build-ipk.sh` -> `scripts/stage-package.sh` -> `scripts/pack-ipk.py`
  is the local build; the release workflow builds from the SDK `Makefile`
  instead, so anything that must ship has to be in **both**
- `scripts/release.sh` - tag, watch the release, rebuild the feed, install
- `scripts/deploy-luci.sh` - push page assets to one router without a release
- `scripts/health-check.sh` - read-only sweep across routers

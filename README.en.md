**[مستندات فارسی](README.md)**

A LuCI application that connects your OpenWrt router to an IKEv2 server,
decides which traffic goes through the tunnel, and can optionally turn the
router into an IKEv2 server for your own phones and laptops.

Every setting is stored in UCI, and the application does not touch strongSwan,
PBR, sing-box, dnsmasq or nftables until you explicitly allow it.

## 1. Installation

### Before you start

- Take a **backup** of the router configuration (`System → Backup / Flash Firmware`).
- Make sure you have enough free space: the dependencies (strongSwan, PBR,
  sing-box, `dnsmasq-full`, `dnsproxy`) are sizeable.
- Stay on a stable network while installing, because DNS/DHCP may restart
  briefly during dependency installation.

### Step 1: find out which package your router needs

On the router, over SSH:

```sh
cat /etc/openwrt_release
apk --print-arch 2>/dev/null || opkg print-architecture
```

- If `apk` answers, your router needs an **APK** (OpenWrt 25.12 and newer).
- If only `opkg` exists, your router needs an **IPK** (OpenWrt 24.10).

The two are not interchangeable. The `version`, `target` and `DISTRIB_ARCH`
fields must match the file you download exactly.

### Step 2a: install on OpenWrt 24.10 (IPK)

Download the latest `luci-app-ikev2-manager_*_all.ipk` from
[Releases](https://github.com/dreamboxone/ikev2-openwrt/releases).

**From LuCI:**

1. Open `System → Software → Upload Package`.
2. Select and install the IPK.
3. Go to `Services → IKEv2 Manager`.

**Or over SSH:**

```sh
scp -O luci-app-ikev2-manager_*_all.ipk root@ROUTER:/tmp/
scp -O scripts/install.sh root@ROUTER:/tmp/
ssh root@ROUTER
chmod +x /tmp/install.sh
/tmp/install.sh /tmp/luci-app-ikev2-manager_*_all.ipk
```

### Step 2b: install on OpenWrt 25.12 (APK)

Download only the APK built for your router's exact release, target and
architecture. Verify the SHA-256 published beside the release before
installing. Release APKs are deliberately unsigned, so installation needs
`--allow-untrusted`:

```sh
apk add --allow-untrusted /tmp/luci-app-ikev2-manager_*.apk
```

> Do not run `apk upgrade` without a package name; it can change unrelated
> kernel modules on the router.

### Step 3: install the dependencies

Go to `Services → IKEv2 Manager → Overview` and press **Install
dependencies**. The application first checks the release, the feeds, available
storage and package compatibility, then installs.

Do not continue until every check under **Runtime dependencies** is **green**.

### Step 4: enable the application

On the same Overview page:

1. Choose the **WAN network** (the router's real uplink).
2. Choose the **protected networks** (usually `lan`).
3. Turn on **Let the app manage the router** and apply.

### Step 5: enter your account

Open the **Outbound Tunnel** tab and fill in the Connection section:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Remote address | IPv4 address or hostname of the IKEv2 server |
| Remote identity | usually the FQDN in the server certificate |
| EAP username | your account username |
| Authentication method | `EAP-MSCHAPv2` for username/password accounts |
| New EAP password | your account password |

Then press **Save & Apply** and **Connect**. The result appears in the status
card on the page and in `Status → Overview`.

> Do not add any domain or device to the VPN policy until the outbound tunnel
> is healthy. Verify one test destination first.

## 2. Option reference

### Overview tab

The starting point of every installation. Do not enable the application until
the checks are green.

| Option | What it does | Practical note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Install dependencies** | Installs the missing VPN, DNS and PBR packages. | Replacing `dnsmasq-full` may restart DNS/DHCP briefly. |
| **Tunnel routing: Pause/Resume** | Temporarily sends selected destinations out through WAN instead of the VPN, without deleting anything. | While paused there is no fail-closed guarantee. Use it for troubleshooting only. |
| **WAN network** | The router's main internet interface. | Must be the real uplink. The inbound server also uses UDP 500 and 4500 on it. |
| **Protected networks** | The LAN/VLAN networks the VPN policy applies to. | Never select WAN or an external management network. |
| **Let the app manage the router** | Hands ownership of route, PBR, DNS and firewall to the application. | Turn it off before removing the package or reworking the network. |
| **Device rules** | Lists LAN devices and their exceptions. | Each exception can bypass PBR, DNS interception and DPI separately. |
| **Redirect plain DNS** | Sends port 53 from protected devices to the router's resolver. | Needed for reliable domain routing. |
| **Block DNS-over-TLS** | Blocks outbound port 853 to WAN. | Stops clients bypassing domain classification, but affects some of them. |
| **Reset application** | Prepares the package for removal and reverts the managed state. | Settings, users and secrets are erased. Back up first. |

**Runtime dependencies** is status only. If strongSwan versions are installed
inconsistently, the application deliberately refuses to mix them; fix the
firmware and official feeds first.

### Outbound Tunnel tab

Connects **your router to a VPN server**. Do not confuse it with the Inbound
Server tab.

| Option | Behaviour | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Enable client** | Lets the health watcher restore the tunnel after boot or a WAN drop. | Turn on after one successful manual connection. |
| **Remote address** | IPv4 or hostname of the server. | The hostname must resolve from the router itself. |
| **Remote identity** | The identity expected in the server certificate. | Usually the certificate FQDN, not the IP. |
| **EAP username** / **New EAP password** | Credentials for EAP-MSCHAPv2. | The password is write-only; leaving it blank keeps the stored secret. |
| **Authentication method** | `EAP-MSCHAPv2`, `Certificate (X.509)` or `EAP-TLS`. | Only pick what the server actually offers. |
| **Client certificate / private key path** | For the two certificate-based methods. Enter a path on the router or upload the file from your computer. | Up to 64 KB, PEM format, unencrypted private key. |
| **CA certificate** | Trust root used to verify the server. | Do not disable certificate checking; fix the server chain instead. |
| **DPD, MTU, rekey, reauth** | Liveness timer, packet size and SA renewal. | Keep the recommended values unless there is a clear reason. A smaller MTU helps on constrained links. |
| **Custom strongSwan config** | Replaces the generated profile with raw configuration. | Expert only. The normal form has no runtime effect until you reset to generated. |
| **Connect / Disconnect** | Brings the outbound SA up or down. | Connect validates first and reports the actual cause of a failure. |

**Tunnel DNS** resolves VPN destinations from inside the tunnel; the first
endpoint is primary and the rest are ordered fallbacks. Bootstrap servers must
be valid IPv4 addresses on port 53.

**Destination DNS segments** give specific suffixes their own resolver group.
Overlapping suffixes between segments are rejected.

### Policy Routing tab

This tab **does not change the VPN server**. It only decides which
destinations the protected networks reach through the tunnel.

| Section | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Iranian destinations via WAN** | One switch downloads and validates lists of Iranian domains and IP ranges, and places the WAN rules **ahead of** the VPN rules. "Your own additions" lets you add your own domains or networks. The lists refresh daily, and **Update lists now** does it immediately. |
| **Domain routing engine** | Standard mode classifies a domain by its resolved public IP. Reliable mode uses FakeIP/TProxy and survives address changes. Prefer Reliable for CDN-backed services. |
| **Route router services by domain policy** | In Reliable mode, the router's own requests to selected domains also use the tunnel. Local management addresses stay direct. |
| **Logging** | Errors and Warnings suit day-to-day use. Higher levels fill the router log quickly. Timed capture lasts 60 seconds. |
| **Services** | Select a service chip, then press the page Save; selecting a chip alone does not apply the policy. Broad services may route unrelated sites too. |
| **Manage services** | Inspect, edit or create services. The identifier is lowercase letters, digits and underscores, and cannot be changed later. |
| **Custom domains** | One suffix per line, such as `example.com`; subdomains are included and service updates never overwrite this list. |
| **Custom IP addresses and networks** | One IPv4 or CIDR per line, such as `203.0.113.0/24`; works without DNS. Avoid very broad networks. |

After saving, check the policy card. If the tunnel is down, selected
destinations are blocked — that is the fail-closed behaviour, not a fault.

> **About the Iranian lists:** the data comes from
> [Iran-clash-rules](https://github.com/Chocolate4U/Iran-clash-rules)
> (GPL-3.0) and is downloaded at enable time, not shipped in the package. No
> list can identify every service, new address or shared CDN without error.
> Traffic that goes straight to an unknown IP, or whose DNS is resolved
> outside the router, may not be identifiable by domain alone. If a download
> fails, the previous configuration is kept.

### Inbound Server tab (optional)

Only needed if you want your own phone or laptop to reach **this router** from
outside. Leave it off if you only use the outbound tunnel.

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Enabled / Public identity** | Enables the server and sets the public DNS name in the certificate. It must reach the router's WAN from the internet. |
| **Client IPv4 pool / gateway** | Address range for inbound clients. Must not overlap LAN, WAN or another pool. |
| **DNS for VPN clients** | The resolver handed to inbound clients, usually the router's IP. |
| **Traffic selectors** | Whether an inbound user sends all traffic through the tunnel or only reaches internal networks. |
| **Router/WAN zones** | Derived automatically; change only in unusual topologies. |
| **MTU, DPD, rekey, reauth** | Inbound session behaviour. The recommended values suit normal use. |
| **Global access policy** | Default access to the router, public ports, internet and LAN. The Users tab can override it per user. |
| **Edit raw config** | Replaces the whole generated profile. Reset to generated to go back. |

**ACME certificate:** devices need a trusted certificate to accept the inbound
server. With DNS-01 enter the provider and its API credentials; with HTTP-01
port 80 must reach the router from the internet. Save the ACME settings first,
then request the certificate. Staging is for testing only.

### VPN Users tab

Only meaningful with the inbound server enabled.

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Add user** | Creates a username and password. Use a separate account per device. |
| **Access policy** | Inherits the server-wide policy or overrides it for this user. |
| **Router access** | Whether the user may reach the router itself. |
| **Public router ports** | Allowed TCP/UDP ports, open even when router access is denied. |
| **Internet access** | Normal egress to WAN. |
| **Local network access** | All networks, only selected addresses, or none. |
| **PBR participation** | Whether the user follows the project's routing policy or goes direct through WAN. |
| **Download profile** | Builds an iOS, Windows or Android connection profile. Apple and Android files contain the password; delete them after import. |
| **Change password / Delete / Disconnect** | Replaces the secret, removes the user, or ends an active session. |
| **Capture for 60 seconds** | Takes a short strongSwan trace for inbound connection problems. |

## 3. Uninstalling

Follow this order so route, PBR, DNS and firewall are handed back to the
router:

1. On the **Overview** tab, turn **off** "Let the app manage the router" and apply.
2. If you also want settings, users and secrets erased, press **Reset
   application** (back up first).
3. Remove the package:

```sh
# OpenWrt 25.12
apk del luci-app-ikev2-manager

# OpenWrt 24.10
opkg remove luci-app-ikev2-manager
```

> Skipping step 1 can leave routing and firewall rules behind. If removal
> reports an error, run `doctor` from the Overview page first.

**Upgrading** is simpler: installing a newer IPK or APK keeps your settings,
users, certificates and personal lists.

## Troubleshooting

A healthy outbound tunnel shows a CHILD_SA named `proxy4`, a virtual address on
`ipsec-out`, and PBR and the health service running.

If the tunnel will not come up, check in order: the hostname and remote
identity, the CA certificate, the router's clock, the authentication method,
and the strongSwan log. Then repair the dependencies without changing the
installed versions.

## Building from source

```sh
./scripts/ci-check.sh
```

The IPK is written to `dist/`. Building an APK needs the official SDK for the
exact target; see [OpenWrt 25.12 and APK](docs/OPENWRT25.md).
